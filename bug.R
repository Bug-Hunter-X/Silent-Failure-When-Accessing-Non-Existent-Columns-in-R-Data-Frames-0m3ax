```R
# Example illustrating the issue
df <- data.frame(col1 = c(1, 2, 3), col2 = c("a", "b", "c"))

# Attempting to access a non-existent column
result <- df$col3

# This will not throw an error, but will return NULL.  This can be problematic if not handled.
print(result)

#This is problematic because later operations assuming a column exists may fail silently
#For example, attempting to compute the mean of col3 will return NA instead of an error
print(mean(result, na.rm = TRUE))
```
